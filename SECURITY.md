# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

pirates encourages users to upgrade to the [latest version](https://github.com/danez/pirates/releases).

Only the latest released version of pirates is actively supported. When reporting bugs or security issues, we encourage you to first upgrade to the latest version and confirm that the problem still exists.

We patch bugs and security relevant issues in the latest version and recommend upgrading. pirates goes to great length to ensure backwards compatibility so upgrading is almost always painless.

We will backport security fixes if needed to previous major versions.
